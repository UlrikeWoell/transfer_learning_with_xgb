## Context

This repository accompanies the Master thesis "Transfer Learning with XGBoost for Tabular Data".
A PDF of the thesis is available in this repository.

## Structure of this repository

1. **src** contains the Python files to replicate the results of the thesis.
    1. **data_generating_process**: files needed to replicate the experimental data
    1. **xgboost_training**: files  needed to execute the suggested transfer learning methods
    1. **analytics**: Scripts to exectue the strategies on all datasets and generate the figures 
        - first run ```create_data.py```
        - then run ```build_models.py```

2. **data** will store the following files when you run the scripts in ```analytics```
    - .csv and .json files generated by ```create_data.py```
